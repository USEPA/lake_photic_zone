# Introduction

During a time of unprecedented variability, lakes can serve as sentinels and integrators in a changing world (Williamson et al. 2009, Schindler 2009).  As the average global air temperature on Earth increases (0.15-0.20 °C per decade since 1975)(NASA GISS), Surface temperatures of lakes are also increasing globally (0.34 per decade from 1985 to 2009) [@o2015rapid].  The influence of this increased temperature touches all biotic and abiotic components of lentic ecosystems.  Ultimately, temperature changes will greatly impact all aspects of lake resource management.  For example, temperature, in addition to nutrients, is a key driver to cyanobacteria bloom dynamics [@paerl2012climate].  During periods of higher temperature, cyanobacteria species dominate the phytoplankton community [@lurling2013comparison; @o2012rise; @peperzak2003climate].  As lake temperature increase (typically above 25°C), cyanobacteria have a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton and can proliferate quickly [@paerl2008blooms].  Moreover, experimentally enhanced water temperatures yielded significantly increased growth rates of higher toxic Microcystis, but not the non-toxic strains [@davis2009effects].  Thus, our ability to understand and predict toxin cyanobacteria blooms will be deeply dependent on our ability to forecast lake photic zone temperature.   This need for accurate lake temperature forecasting is will become crucial for protecting human and environmental health.

Therefore, it is not surprising that modelling near-surface lake temperature has been broadly researched.  These studies typically vary in number of lakes studied, complexity of modelling approach, and time interval.  Modelling efforts include efforts to model a single lake predicted over relatively small-time intervals (like hourly predictions).  Such studies include: [@saeed2016water; @peeters2002modelin; @zhong2016recent].  There are numerous studies that model temperature for a small number of lakes while attempting to limit the number of predictor variables [@matuszek1996empirical; @kettle2004empirical, @livingstone1998relationship; @piccolroaz2016prediction; @toffolon2014prediction].  By and large, air temperature and lake size are often the only selected predictor variables.  Finally, very few modelling efforts attempt to predict lake temperature across large spatial extents for large number of lakes.  Yet some examples include: [@minns2017factors; @o2015rapid; @wan2017comprehensive].  Despite this great variation in approach and execution, most have been rather successful modelling lake photic zone temperature, although it is important to note that the majority of these lakes are large.  Considering that the number and importance of small lakes (< 1km2) has been historically underestimated, it is important to also predict temperatures in these small lakes (Downing et al. 2006, Winslow et al. 2014).
